During the search. 
================== 
If score never gets to alpha we save the node as FailLow. But no move is saved 
If score increases alpha we save the node as exact, and the move that caused this. 
If score > beta we save the node as a FailHigh node and the move that caused this. 
If during a null move we have a beta cut, we save the node as FailHigh.......what move do we save ? 

Before the search. 
================== 
Lookup the node. 

IF its a FailLow node don't do a NullMove search. 

IF the TT height >= Depth then the info is good to use 
{If it is an Exact node just return the score. 
Alpha = Max(Alpha, NodeScore) 
If Alpha >= Beta then its a beta cut, return Beta.} 
ELSE 
Search the stored move since it still may give a cutoff even if the height < Depth. 



So if a null move causes a beta cut we don't have a move to save. What do we do here ? 


Thanks

Some terminology to make sure you avoid mistakes: 

You store an UPPER flag, indicating that this is a bound, but it is an upper bound. The actual score might be lower. 
If you think about alpha/beta, when you search all moves, you know that the score can't be > alpha, and that it is probably
 lower. Hence alpha is an UPPER bound on the score (sounds backward, but this is the terminology everyone uses). 

You store a LOWER flag, indicating that this is a lower bound. IE the search returned a value >= beta, so you store beta.
 But beta is a LOWER bound on the score which is probably higher. 

EXACT is pretty obvious. 

A couple of mistakes in your comments: 

(1) if score is >= beta, you should store LOWER. NOT just > beta. 

(2) ditto for score <= alpha, you store UPPER, not just < alpha. 

For the null-move question, if it failed high, you don't have a move to save. 

For the lookup part, that seems a bit confused. You have three cases, all assume that stored draft >= remaining depth of course. 

(1) entry = EXACT. Just return that value instantly. 

(2) entry = LOWER. If tt bound is >= beta, then you can return beta instantly. 

(3) entry = UPPER. If tt bound is <= alpha, then you can return alpha instantly. 

The easy way to think of this is as follows. Whatever you did when you stored the entry, you want to do the SAME thing here
, exactly, assuming the draft is sufficient and the bounds satisfy the above tests. If you searched all moves without
 modifying alpha and then stored that result, then you want to return alpha here just like you did when you stored the
 entry.
